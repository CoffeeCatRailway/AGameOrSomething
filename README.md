A game or something, idk

#### Brief Summary
A random project I started working on to refresh my LWJGL knowledge.<br/>
Parts of this project are based off a [series by Warmful Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILiqflMilIxta2xKk2EftiRHD4nQGW0u).

#### Gameplay Inspiration
- Combat - Terraria & Core Keeper
- World/Exploration - Minecraft & Core Keeper
- Art/Graphics - Minecraft (Visuals) with Core Keeper like 2D top-down view
- Overall Gameplay - Exploration RPG with survival & resource gathering
